# HR-Employee-Analysis
This project demonstrate in SQL and analyze complex data. They exhibits in data investigation, visualization, and analysis.

Analyzing Employee Trends

# Project Description
This project involved performing extensive analysis on HR employee data to uncover insights and trends. The data contained information on employees across departments, including demographics, job roles, satisfaction, attrition and more.

# Tasks Performed
Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the HR dataset

Wrote SQL queries to analyze employee counts, averages, distributions across various dimensions like department, age, education etc.

Identified top job roles and satisfaction levels by department to understand departmental trends

Calculated employee attrition rates by age band to pinpoint high risk groups

Analyzed factors related to attrition like age, education, job satisfaction to uncover drivers

Compared averages and aggregates across different employee segments and criteria

Identified top and bottom performers on key metrics like satisfaction, attrition based on criteria

Used SQL techniques like JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE statements for complex analysis

Organized and presented findings in a clear format for consumption by leadership

# Exploring Trends in Automotive Industry

This involved performing extensive analysis on a database of car sales information to uncover insights into pricing trends, model performance, and more. The data contained details on car models, pricing history, mileage, transmission types and other attributes.

# Tasks Performed
Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the cars dataset

Analyzed average selling prices by various dimensions like transmission, fuel type, ownership etc. to reveal pricing patterns

Identified highest mileage models to understand durability and maintenance costs

Computed price variability within and across models to guide pricing strategy

Compared pricing and mileage metrics vs overall averages to find outliers

Generated cumulative price trends over time and YoY comparisons for price forecasting

Computed complex iterative analytics like moving averages for price smoothing

Summarized total mileage by transmission for maintenance and repair planning

Ranked models by selling price and analyzed historical averages for top models

Used SQL techniques like WINDOW functions, CTEs, JOINs for advanced analysis

Presented findings in a clear format for consumption by leadership and stakeholders

# About SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language for interacting with relational databases. Key SQL capabilities:

CRUD operations - create, read, update, delete data
Joins - combine data from multiple tables
Aggregate functions - summations, counts, averages on data
Subqueries - nested queries for advanced operations
Stored procedures - reusable routines for logic
Window functions - analytics functions for rankings etc.
For these examples, I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

# Installation
Install a SQL database such as SQL Server Express
Import any .sql files to run the queries
Modify the queries for your own database
